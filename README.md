## Overview
Password security is an important factor of keeping one's online information safe. It can be mind numbing to create a series of passwords over and over in order to protect one's sensitive and personal information on the internet. This application provides a series of questions for the user to choose how long and how complicated it wants the password to be. After the user makes their choice between length of password, numbers, special characters, upper and/or lower case letters, the password generator returns to them a randomized password based on these characteristics.
